San Francisco Muni Bus Flow Visualization

This is Qt/C++ code written for a GAFFTA contest. I experimented with two hypotheses with this contest:

1. [Using makefiles to specify workflow data dependencies](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/make/) can greatly simplify reproducable visualization pipelines.
2. Using a fast to run language like C++ can increase iterations and freedom to explore creative ideas, despite requiring more effort to write than quick JavaScript or python visualizations.

Both seemed to be useful, and I've since used makefiles and C++ for further fast data processing and visualization tasks. The end results are available online:
