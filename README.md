San Francisco Muni Bus Flow Visualization

This is Qt/C++ code written for a GAFFTA contest. I experimented with two hypotheses with this contest:

1. [Using makefiles to specify workflow data dependencies](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/make/) can greatly simplify reproducablevisualization pipelines.
2. Using a fast to run language like C++ can increase iterations and freedom to explore creative ideas, despite requiring more effort to write than quick JavaScript or python visualizations.

While I did not win the contenst, I gained from these learnings with both of these experiments having successful outcomes. The end results are available online:
